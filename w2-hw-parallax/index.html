        <p><strong>Richard Danne</strong> was involved with NASA starting in the &rsquo;70s, and among his peers, the mood was dark. &ldquo;A lot of us felt that our countryâ€¦was way behind,&rdquo; he explains. Not in terms of the space race, which we were winning, but &ldquo;in terms of design&rsquo;s role in society.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Danne wasn&rsquo;t a test pilot or engineer, but a graphic designer. In 1973 he formed the Danne and Blackburn design studio with partner Bruce Blackburn, and just a year later the fledgling firm had landed a big-league contract: To design the graphics standards for NASA. </p>

        <p>NASA sported <em>Danne &amp; Blackburn</em>'s design work for some 18 years, until a new director canned it in 1992. Now <em>Pentagram</em> partners/designers Jesse Reed and Hamish Smyth, the guys who got the 1970s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thestandardsmanual/full-size-reissue-of-the-nycta-graphics-standards" target="_blank"><span></span>New York City Transit Authority&#8217;s Graphics Standards Manual</a> back into print last year, are <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thestandardsmanual/reissue-of-the-1975-nasa-graphics-standards-manual" target="_blank">looking to do the same for Danne &amp; Blackburn's NASA work</a>. </p>

        <p>The response on <em>Kickstarter</em> has been tremendous; at press time they&rsquo;d garnered $650,000 on a $158,000 target. Bringing back classic graphic design is big business, it seems; their earlier NYCTA campaign landed $802,812 on a $108,000 goal. For those of you who'd like a copy of the NASA book, there&rsquo;s still 27 days left. Buy-in starts at $79. </p>

        <p>Given Danne&rsquo;s background in design that has been to outer space, we tried to contact him to see if he knows the architect of the Death Star. Our messages were not returned.</p>
